As college applications approached in my final year of high school, I realized Engineering wasn’t the right fit for me and eventually fell down the Computer Science rabbit hole. Surprisingly, I’ve been enjoying every aspect of it ever since, from solving problems at the hardware level to building full-stack applications.",
