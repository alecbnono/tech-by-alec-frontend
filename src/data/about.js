    title: "My Journey",
    text: "My interest in technology started as early as three years old. Growing up, I didn’t see it as a career path — just a tool to make life easier. As college applications approached in my final year of high school, I realized Engineering wasn’t the right fit for me and eventually fell down the Computer Science rabbit hole. Surprisingly, I’ve been enjoying every aspect of it ever since, from solving problems at the hardware level to building full-stack applications.",

    title: "Life outside Code",
    text: "When I’m not buried in lines of code, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen, experimenting with recipes—sometimes nailing the perfect comfort dish, sometimes ending up with a “learning experience.” Music is always close by, especially hip-hop, which fuels my focus and keeps me in the zone. \n\n I’m also a big fan of Filipino stand-up comedy, especially the sharp wit of Comedy Manila and the unfiltered humor of Koolpals. Beyond the laughs, I admire how comedians use humor as a bridge—breaking the ice, easing tension, and making strangers feel like friends. It’s inspired me to bring the same energy into how I connect with people: using humor to spark conversations, build rapport, and make interactions feel a little more human. \n\n Lately, I’ve also been exploring the world of fragrances—learning how different scents can capture moods, memories, and even stories. Whether it’s coding, cooking, comedy, or cologne, I love finding the little details that make an experience memorable.",
